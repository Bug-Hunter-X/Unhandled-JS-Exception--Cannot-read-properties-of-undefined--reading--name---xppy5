# React Native: Accessing State Before Initialization

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native: attempting to access a state variable before it's been initialized. This often happens with asynchronous operations where the component renders before the state updates.

## Bug Description

The bug occurs when the component tries to access `this.state.data.name` before the `data` property in the state has been populated from an API call.  This results in a `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')` error.

## Solution

The solution involves adding a check to ensure the state variable is initialized before accessing its properties.  Conditional rendering or optional chaining can be used effectively.
